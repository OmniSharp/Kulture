#Getting Started

This tutorial will show you how you can get started with ASP.NET vNext in Sublime Text 3. After completing this tutorial you will be familiar with how to use Sublime Kulture and its primary features.

To get started you can use [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)

 > Note: This requires you to have node.js and npm already installed

    npm install -g yo
    npm install -g generator-aspnet

To run the yeoman scaffolder, type

    yo aspnet


Let's go ahead and create a new Web project using ```yo aspnet```. In Sublime, click on `File -> Open Folder` and navigate to the folder to open it up.

  > Note: In Sublime for Mac use the `File -> Open` command

Since we just grabbed this from source control there are NuGet packages which this project requires that are missing. To restore the NuGet packages

- Press `Ctrl(Cmd) + Shift + P` to bring up the command palette
- Type `Run K Commands` and hit Enter (Return)
- Type `dnu restore` and hit Enter (Return)

_Note:_ when executing `dnu restore` if you get an error about missing NuGet packages you can execute the alternate command `dnu restore -s https://www.myget.org/F/aspnetvnext/api/v2`

You should see a Terminal/Powershell window launch and execute your commands.

Now, let's go ahead and tell Sublime to use `ASP.NET` as the build system. To do this, click `Tools -> Build System -> ASP.NET`

- Press `Ctrl(Cmd) + B` or `F7` to build projects

You should be able to see the output of your build in the output window towards the bottom of your screen. At this point your code should have built successfully.

Now let's see what the experience looks like if there is an error in your .cs file. Introduce an error in the Startup.cs file and try building again. You should now see errors in the output window. You can navigate through the errors as follows

- `F4` takes you to the next error
- `Shft + F4` takes you to the previous error

When an error has focus it will be highlighted in the build results and your cursor will be taken to the line and column where the error was reported.

After we resolve all the errors we have introduced, let us try and run the application

- Press `Ctrl(Cmd) + Shift + P` to bring up the command palette
- Type `Run K Commands` and hit Enter (Return)
- Type `dnx web` and hit Enter (Return)
- If you are on a Mac or Linux, type `dnx kestrel` and hit Enter (Return)

You should see a Terminal/Powershell window launch and start running your server. You can navigate to `http://localhost:5001` (or `http://localhost:5000` on a Mac) in your favorite browser you view the website.

#Intellisense

To be able to get intellisense working within Sublime please install [OmnisharpSublime](https://github.com/moonrabbit/OmniSharpSublime) (follow the instructions in the README).

To get intellisense with `ASP.Net vNext` projects you need to create a project file in Sublime. Go to `Project - Save Project As` and enter in a name for your project.  `OmniSharpSublime` will use this to know what files and assemblies it needs to provide intellisense for (**TIP** : Close & Re-Open Sublime if you do not see intellisense, it may take 10 secs for the intellisense server [OmniSharpServer](https://github.com/nosami/OmniSharpServer) to start once Sublime has loaded all the plugins)

Once OmniSharpSublime is installed and you have a project file you should be able to see intellisense:
